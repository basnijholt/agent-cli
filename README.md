# Agent CLI

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/basnijholt/agent-cli/refs/heads/main/.github/logo.svg" alt="agent-cli logo" align="right" style="width: 250px;" />

`agent-cli` is a collection of **_local-first_**, AI-powered command-line agents that run entirely on your machine.
It provides a suite of powerful tools for voice and text interaction, designed for privacy, offline capability, and seamless integration with system-wide hotkeys and workflows.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Local and Private by Design**
> All agents in this tool are designed to run **100% locally**.
> Your data, whether it's from your clipboard, microphone, or files, is never sent to any cloud API.
> This ensures your privacy and allows the tools to work completely offline.
> You can also optionally configure the agents to use OpenAI/Gemini services.

## Why I built this

I got tired of typing long prompts to LLMs. Speaking is faster, so I built this tool to transcribe my voice directly to the clipboard with a hotkey.

What it does:
- Voice transcription to clipboard with system-wide hotkeys (Cmd+Shift+R on macOS)
- Autocorrect any text from your clipboard
- Edit clipboard content with voice commands ("make this more formal")
- Runs locally - no internet required, your audio stays on your machine
- Works with any app that can copy/paste

I use it mostly for the `transcribe` function when working with LLMs. Being able to speak naturally means I can provide more context without the typing fatigue.

## Features

- **`autocorrect`**: Correct grammar and spelling in your text (e.g., from clipboard) using a local LLM with Ollama or OpenAI.
- **`transcribe`**: Transcribe audio from your microphone to text in your clipboard using a local Whisper model or OpenAI's Whisper API.
- **`speak`**: Convert text to speech using a local TTS engine or OpenAI's TTS API.
- **`voice-edit`**: A voice-powered clipboard assistant that edits text based on your spoken commands.
- **`assistant`**: A hands-free voice assistant that starts and stops recording based on a wake word.
- **`chat`**: A conversational AI agent with tool-calling capabilities.

## Quick Start

### Just want the CLI tool?

If you already have AI services running (or plan to use OpenAI), simply install:

```bash
# Using uv (recommended)
uv tool install agent-cli

# Using pip

## Usage

This package provides multiple command-line tools, each designed for a specific purpose.

### Configuration

All `agent-cli` commands can be configured using a TOML file. The configuration file is searched for in the following locations, in order:

1.  `./agent-cli-config.toml` (in the current directory)
2.  `~/.config/agent-cli/config.toml`

You can also specify a path to a configuration file using the `--config` option, e.g., `agent-cli transcribe --config /path/to/your/config.toml`.

Command-line options always take precedence over settings in the configuration file.

An example configuration file is provided in `example.agent-cli-config.toml`.

#### Service Provider

You can choose to use local services (Wyoming/Ollama) or OpenAI services by setting the `service_provider` option in the `[defaults]` section of your configuration file.

```toml
[defaults]
# service_provider = "openai"  # 'local' or 'openai'
# openai_api_key = "sk-..."
```

### `autocorrect`

**Purpose:** Quickly fix spelling and grammar in any text you've copied.

**Workflow:** This is a simple, one-shot command.

1.  It reads text from your system clipboard (or from a direct argument).
2.  It sends the text to a local Ollama LLM with a prompt to perform only technical corrections.
3.  The corrected text is copied back to your clipboard, replacing the original.

**How to Use It:** This tool is ideal for integrating with a system-wide hotkey.

- **From Clipboard**: `agent-cli autocorrect`
- **From Argument**: `agent-cli autocorrect "this text has an eror"`

### `transcribe`

**Purpose:** A simple tool to turn your speech into text.

**Workflow:** This agent listens to your microphone and converts your speech to text in real-time.

1.  Run the command. It will start listening immediately.
2.  Speak into your microphone.
3.  Press `Ctrl+C` to stop recording.
4.  The transcribed text is copied to your clipboard.
5.  Optionally, use the `--llm` flag to have an Ollama model clean up the raw transcript (fixing punctuation, etc.).

**How to Use It:**

- **Simple Transcription**: `agent-cli transcribe --input-device-index 1`
- **With LLM Cleanup**: `agent-cli transcribe --input-device-index 1 --llm`

### `speak`

**Purpose:** Reads any text out loud.

**Workflow:** A straightforward text-to-speech utility.

1.  It takes text from a command-line argument or your clipboard.
2.  It sends the text to a Wyoming TTS server (like Piper).
3.  The generated audio is played through your default speakers.

**How to Use It:**

- **Speak from Argument**: `agent-cli speak "Hello, world!"`
- **Speak from Clipboard**: `agent-cli speak`
- **Save to File**: `agent-cli speak "Hello" --save-file hello.wav`

</details>

### `voice-edit`

**Purpose:** A powerful clipboard assistant that you command with your voice.

**Workflow:** This agent is designed for a hotkey-driven workflow to act on text you've already copied.

1.  Copy a block of text to your clipboard (e.g., an email draft).
2.  Press a hotkey to run `agent-cli voice-edit &` in the background. The agent is now listening.
3.  Speak a command, such as "Make this more formal" or "Summarize the key points."
4.  Press the same hotkey again, which should trigger `agent-cli voice-edit --stop`.
5.  The agent transcribes your command, sends it along with the original clipboard text to the LLM, and the LLM performs the action.
6.  The result is copied back to your clipboard. If `--tts` is enabled, it will also speak the result.

**How to Use It:** The power of this tool is unlocked with a hotkey manager like Keyboard Maestro (macOS) or AutoHotkey (Windows). See the docstring in `agent_cli/agents/voice_edit.py` for a detailed Keyboard Maestro setup guide.

### `assistant`

**Purpose:** A hands-free voice assistant that starts and stops recording based on a wake word.

**Workflow:** This agent continuously listens for a wake word (e.g., "Hey Nabu").

1.  Run the `assistant` command. It will start listening for the wake word.
2.  Say the wake word to start recording.
3.  Speak your command or question.
4.  Say the wake word again to stop recording.
5.  The agent transcribes your speech, sends it to the LLM, and gets a response.
6.  The agent speaks the response back to you and then immediately starts listening for the wake word again.

**How to Use It:**

- **Start the agent**: `agent-cli assistant --wake-word "ok_nabu" --input-device-index 1`
- **With TTS**: `agent-cli assistant --wake-word "ok_nabu" --tts --voice "en_US-lessac-medium"`

</details>

### `chat`

**Purpose:** A full-featured, conversational AI assistant that can interact with your system.

**Workflow:** This is a persistent, conversational agent that you can have a conversation with.

1.  Run the `chat` command. It will start listening for your voice.
2.  Speak your command or question (e.g., "What's in my current directory?").
3.  The agent transcribes your speech, sends it to the LLM, and gets a response. The LLM can use tools like `read_file` or `execute_code` to answer your question.
4.  The agent speaks the response back to you and then immediately starts listening for your next command.
5.  The conversation continues in this loop. Conversation history is saved between sessions.

**Interaction Model:**

- **To Interrupt**: Press `Ctrl+C` **once** to stop the agent from either listening or speaking, and it will immediately return to a listening state for a new command. This is useful if it misunderstands you or you want to speak again quickly.
- **To Exit**: Press `Ctrl+C` **twice in a row** to terminate the application.

**How to Use It:**

- **Start the agent**: `agent-cli chat --input-device-index 1 --tts`
- **Have a conversation**:
  - _You_: "Read the pyproject.toml file and tell me the project version."
  - _AI_: (Reads file) "The project version is 0.1.0."
  - _You_: "Thanks!"
