# Development Rules

## Core Rules
- Always use `uv --all-extras` to install packages
- Commit frequently but always make sure tests pass first
- Prefer functional style Python instead of classes with inheritance
- Keep it DRY - reuse code as much as possible
- Always run pre-commit hooks before committing
